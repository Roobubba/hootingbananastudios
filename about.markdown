Hooting Banana Studios is (currently!) a one-man indie game developer, specialising in science-inspired games and software.

That one man is Isaac Westwood, an ex-scientist turned game developer. I used to solve the 3D structures of proteins, and wanted to make some of that weird, alien microscopic world more accessible and alive. My first game, AlCHeMoS, includes lots of real scientific data - from the environments of every level to the radioactivity of atomic isotopes and the sizes of atoms, but is not designed specifically to be an educational game and does not require any specialist knowledge to play!
