A mysterious Dark Energy has stolen all the elements!

We need your unique alchemical skills to rediscover the elements, but beware the dangers a lonesome atom faces!

Atoms in AlCHeMoS are based on real experimental data for atomic radius, radioactivity and nuclear stability - be careful to avoid becoming radioactive, or undergoing fusion with a larger atom, as you try to unlock powerful atomic abilities in your quest to master the periodic table and restore balance!

Features:
* Discover each of the 118 currently known elements
* More than 100 real protein structure environments built on real scientific experimental data!
* Earn quarks to upgrade every aspect of your atom
* Complete a variety of side objectives to earn powerful unlockable abilities
* Flee from or combat enemy atoms who seek to undergo Fusion with you
* Fully raymarched environments with beautiful lighting, reflections, shadows and more
