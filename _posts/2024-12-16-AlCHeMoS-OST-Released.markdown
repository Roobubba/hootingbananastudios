# ALCHEMoS Original Game Soundtrack!

[![ALCHEMoS OST is Out Now on Steam!]({{site.baseurl}}/img/alchemos_ost_Screenshot_100.png)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090590/AlCHeMoS/?utm_source=hbs)

I'm stoked to announce the release of an all-new, remixed, remastered, full-length album featuring all 11 music tracks from the game, available as a standalone album or with the base game in the [ALCHEMoS SONiC Bundle](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/48361/ALCHEMoS_SONiC/) - with a 20% bundle discount.

The album is now (or will very soon be...!) available to stream or buy as a standalone music release from all the usual music outlets including but not limited to:
